    Instructions on how to use: 
Open the project folder using Intellij Idea or Visual studio
code and just run the main class.

    Topics of choice:

    Version Control: 
-Although we had a bit of experience using git before,
this was the first chance to actually use it in a bigger project, where
people could work on multiple things at the same time. Thanks to this, we learned
how to handle conflicts, merges or even accidental deletions with ease. That's
not only it, as we've both learned how to make better use of branches, squashes,
rebases and issue handling.

    Algorithms: 
-This was an entirely new concept to us. Finding the right
fit for whatever our game needed required a lot of reading
and actually understanding the logic behind the chosen algorithms
proved challenging. We learned about concepts like noise generation algorithms
(opted for improved perlin noise in the end) and A* pathfinding algorithms.
Some had tutorials, making understanding them easier, but for others
we had to freestyle some code, adding rules and fitting everything 
in our desired scope. It was really fun, and really made us
plan extensively beforehand. .
